## super simple hello world in express

this is just a hello world blag to show how one would write a blag backend with node. see also: [yab](https://github.com/srecnig/yab).

app structure is built upon [express-example](https://github.com/sequelize/express-example). includes an [orm](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize), has a demo migration and returns json. sadly no tests as of now.
